# FLOATS Test Case

The *floats* test case shows how tag propagation works with floats and
doubles. A simple program does some floating point arithmetic and
writes the results on standard output.

## Debug commands

The debug commands showcase the load, store and arithemtic
instructions that are executed, together with the changes of registers
and memory. At the end the memory location for variables `a`, `b` and
`c` are shown.

## Results

The results are expected - we see tag propagation take effect both on
memory and also on registers.
